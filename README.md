# RecommenderSystem
We're building a simple Recommender System using Content-Based Filtering Method with simple User Interface
the contributor for backend : zaza-ipynb
contributor for integrating backend to UI : mystald


There are several file available in this repository :
1. RecSys.ipynb file for the raw backend
2. book dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/meetnaren/goodreads-best-books
3. main.py for UI architecture
4. cbrs.py is the compressed code from RecSys.ipynb

To see the recommender system with UI simply run main.py until it doesn't show any error like this :

and open localhost:5000 at your browser and it will be like this :
